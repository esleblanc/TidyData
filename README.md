# TidyData

Programming Assignment - Cleaning data - Get tidy data

The goal was to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

To start the project, download the UCI HAR dataset and unzip it to a specific folder.
Set your working directory to said folder.
Run the source code ("run_analysis.R")
This will create an independent data set with the average for each activity and each subejct.
